# FloodingVsDSR

## About the Project

Implementation of Flooding and DSR in an IoT network and comparison of packet dissemination with varying node mobility and packet loss rates (simulated by putting a probability on whether a received packet will be processed by the node or not).

IoT network has been simulated by creating a peer to peer network of nodes which communicate with each other.

Node mobility has been simulated by varying frequency by which a node's neighbors change.

Packet loss rate has been simulated by putting a probability on whether a received packet will be processed by the node or not.
